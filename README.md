## Classes
Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state.
### Double Underscore init (/__init/__)
Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created
### Object Method
Class object could be used to access different attributes
### Class Method
A class method takes **cls** as the first parameter 
### Static Method
