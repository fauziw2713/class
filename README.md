## Datetime
A date in Python is not a data type of its own, but we can import a module named ***datetime*** to work with dates as date objects
### Create Date Object
To create a date, we can use the ***datetime***() class (constructor) of the datetime module.
### strftime() Method
The datetime object has a method for formatting date objects into readable strings.
